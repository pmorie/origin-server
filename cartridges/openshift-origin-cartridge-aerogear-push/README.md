# OpenShift AeroGear Push Server Cartridge

Provides the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ running on top of JBoss Application Server on OpenShift and embeds the _AeroGear SimplePush Server_ within JBoss Application Server on OpenShift. 

The [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server) is a server that allows sending push notifications to different (mobile) platforms. The initial version of the server supports [Apple’s APNs](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH100-SW9), [Google Cloud Messaging](http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html) and [Mozilla’s SimplePush](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush).

The [AeroGear SimplePush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-simplepush-server) is a Java server side implementation of Mozilla's [SimplePush Protocol](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush/Protocol) that describes a JavaScript API and a protocol which allows backend/application developers to send notification messages to their web applications. 

### Installation
The AeroGear Push Server cartridge defaults to using MySQL. When creating your application, you'll also want to add the MySQL cartridge:

```
rhc app create <APP> aerogear-push mysql-5.1
```

### Getting started with the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server

#### Admin UI

Once the server is running access it via ```http://{APP}-{NAMESPACE}-rhcloud.com``` From there you can use the Admin UI. 

**NOTE:** Besides the _Admin UI_, the server can be accessed over RESTful APIs, as explained in the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ [README](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server/blob/master/README.md). When executing the curl commands specified, you'll need to replace all instances of ```http://localhost:8080/ag-push``` with your OpenShift application URL ```http://{APP}-{NAMESPACE}-rhcloud.com```. 

#### Login

Temporarily, there is an "admin:123" user.  On _first_ login,  you will need to change the password.

### Getting started with the AeroGear SimplePush Server

#### Client connections

Client applications should connect to the _AeroGear SimplePush Server_ via ```http://{APP}-{NAMESPACE}-rhcloud.com:8000/simplepush```.

For secured connections, client applications should connect via ```https://{APP}-{NAMESPACE}-rhcloud.com:8443/simplepush```.

### Environment Variables

The `aerogear-push` cartridge provides several environment variables to reference for ease
of use:

    OPENSHIFT_AEROGEAR_PUSH_IP                         The IP address used to bind JBossAS
    OPENSHIFT_AEROGEAR_PUSH_HTTP_PORT                  The JBossAS listening port
    OPENSHIFT_AEROGEAR_PUSH_CLUSTER_PORT               
    OPENSHIFT_AEROGEAR_PUSH_MESSAGING_PORT             
    OPENSHIFT_AEROGEAR_PUSH_MESSAGING_THROUGHPUT_PORT  
    OPENSHIFT_AEROGEAR_PUSH_REMOTING_PORT              

For more information about environment variables, consult the
[OpenShift Application Author Guide](https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/node/README.writing_applications.md).

### Markers

Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

    enable_jpda          Will enable the JPDA socket based transport on the java virtual
                         machine running the JBoss AS 7 application server. This enables
                         you to remotely debug code running inside the JBoss AS 7
                         application server.

    java7                Will run JBossAS with Java7 if present. If no marker is present
                         then the baseline Java version will be used (currently Java6)
